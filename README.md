### Course Content

#### 1. Introduction to IoT Protocols
   - **Definition and Role of IoT**  
     IoT (Internet of Things) connects devices to the internet, enabling real-time data sharing and automation.

   - **Importance of Communication Protocols**  
     Communication protocols facilitate device interaction, allowing for efficient and secure IoT solutions.

#### 2. Types of IoT Protocols
   - **Data Protocols**  
     - **MQTT** (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport): Lightweight, ideal for low-bandwidth communication.
     - **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Heavier, used for web-based applications with complex data needs.

   - **Networking Protocols**  
     - **WiFi**: High-speed, short-range.
     - **Bluetooth**: Low power, short-range, ideal for portable devices.
     - **GSM**: Long-range, used in cellular IoT.
     - **LoRa**: Low-power, long-range, suited for remote IoT.

#### 3. IoT Protocol Selection & Significance
   - **Criteria for Selecting the Right Protocol**  
     Considerations include data rate, power efficiency, latency, network range, and device compatibility.

   - **Comparison Between MQTT and HTTP**  
     - **MQTT**: Efficient for low-bandwidth, real-time messaging.
     - **HTTP**: Better for user-driven applications needing detailed data transfer.

#### 4. OSI Model & Key Layers for IoT
   - **The Seven Layers of the OSI Model**  
     - Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.

   - **Key Layers for IoT Communication**  
     - **Physical Layer**: Involves sensors and device interfaces.
     - **Network Layer**: Defines addressing and routing.
     - **Application Layer**: Manages user interaction with IoT data, typically using MQTT or HTTP.

#### 5. Practical Example 1: ESP32 and MQTT Protocol
  - **Scenario**: Using ESP32 with a DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring.
  - **Objective**: Transmit sensor data via MQTT to HiveMQ.
  - **Key Steps**:
    - Connect ESP32 to WiFi.
    - Program it to read DHT22 data.
    - Publish DHT sensor data to HiveMQ via MQTT.

  - **Configuration**: ESP32 - HiveMQ Connection
    - Go to [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/)
      - Click `Start Free`
      - Next, under **Get Started with HiveMQ**, select `HiveMQ Cloud` by clicking the `Sign Up Free Now` button.
      - You’ll be redirected to a Register/Login prompt page.
        - **Login** (if you already have an account) or **Register** (if you're new) using the provided options.
      - After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to **Select the HiveMQ Cloud plan you need** section.

      - Under the **Serverless** FREE option, click `Create Serverless Cluster` to create a cluster.
      - Once the serverless cluster is created, you'll be redirected to **Your Clusters** section.

      - In the newly created serverless cluster, click `Manage Cluster` to access cluster information.

      - **Cluster Information Section**
        - **Overview**: Provides cluster (HiveMQ broker) information and connection parameters.
          - **Cluster URL**: This is the MQTT server URL required for the broker connection from ESP32 code.
          - **Port 8883**: This is the MQTT server secure connection port required for broker connection from ESP32 code.

        - **Web Client**: Provides a test environment for the HiveMQ broker.

          ![Web Client Section](images/HiveMQ_Web_client.png)

          - **Connection Settings**: Allows you to set `Username` and `Password`, which are required for broker connection from ESP32 code.
            - **Note**:
              - You can create custom credentials (Username & Password) or
              - Use the autogenerated credentials by clicking `connect with autogenerated credentials` (recommended for secure, strong credentials).

              ![Web Client Section](images/HiveMQ_auto_generated_credddentials.png)

            - After entering the Username and Password fields, click the `Connect` button to initiate the broker connection.

            ![Web Client Section](images/HiveMQ_broker_connect.png)

          - **Topic Subscriptions**: Allows you to set MQTT broker `Subscribe topics`.
            - **Note**:
              - Through `topics`, we can `publish` and `subscribe` to the MQTT broker from the ESP32 for sensor data transmission and reception.

            - To set a topic for data publishing from ESP32, enter the defined topic from the ESP32 code in the `TOPIC` field and click `Subscribe`. This puts the HiveMQ broker into listening mode for any data published from ESP32 via the subscribed topics and displays it under the Messages section whenever received.

            ![Web Client Section](images/HiveMQ_Topics_Subscription.png)

          - **Messages**: Provides a data visualization section.
            - Data published from the ESP32 to the HiveMQ broker via subscribed topics is displayed in the Messages section.
            - It’s also possible to publish a message back to the ESP32 via the defined publish topics. Click `Send Message` to send a message to the ESP32 module.

#### 6. Network Topologies
   - **Definition**: Arrangement of nodes and connections in a network.

   - **Types of Topologies**  
     - **Star Topology**: Centralized, vulnerable if hub fails.
     - **Mesh Topology**: High redundancy, reliable.
     - **Bus Topology**: Simple, less scalable.
     - **Ring Topology**: Efficient for small networks.

   - **Topology Selection & Considerations**  
     Factors include network size, scalability, reliability, and maintenance complexity.

#### 7. Practical Example 2: Mesh Topology Demonstration Using ESP32
   - **Scenario**: Using ESP32 devices in a mesh network for a smart home or agriculture setup.
   - **Objective**: Demonstrate data redundancy and network robustness.
   - **Key Steps**:
     - Configure ESP32 devices for mesh.
     - Simulate data transmission in a mesh network.
